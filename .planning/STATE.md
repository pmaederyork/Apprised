## Accumulated Context

### Key Insights from Analysis
- Current content-matching approach is fundamentally fragile
- Each accept/reject triggers full DOM reconstruction (slow)
- Pattern operations rely entirely on Claude generating individual changes
- Four improvement approaches identified: batch ops, stable IDs, client-side patterns, diff-based

### Blockers
None currently.
